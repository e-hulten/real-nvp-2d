# Real NVP 
Basic implementation of the Real NVP paper by Dinh et.al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.08803). 

Currently the model only supports 2D inputs. 

Change the relevant parameters in `train.py` and run!
E.g.,
```
# ------------ parameters ------------
continue_training = False 
moons = True 
n_c_layers = 8 
epochs = 200 
batch_size = 256 
lr = 1e-4 # set the learning rate of the adam optimiser
path = r'/Users/edvardhulten/real_nvp_2d/' # change to your own path (unless your name is Edvard Hult√©n too)
# ------------------------------------
```
should yield good results on the two moons dataset in a reasonable amount of time.
